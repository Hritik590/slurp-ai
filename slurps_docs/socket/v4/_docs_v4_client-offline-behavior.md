## Buffered events[â€‹](_docs_v4_client-offline-behavior.md#buffered-events)

By default, any event emitted while the Socket is not connected will be buffered until reconnection.

While useful in most cases (when the reconnection delay is short), it could result in a huge spike of events when the connection is restored.

There are several solutions to prevent this behavior, depending on your use case:
*   use the [connected](_docs_v4_client-socket-instance_.md#socketconnected) attribute of the Socket instance
```
if (socket.connected) {  
  socket.emit( /* ... */ );} else {  
  // ...}  
```
*   use [volatile events](_docs_v4_emitting-events_.md#volatile-events)
```
socket.volatile.emit( /* ... */ );  
```
